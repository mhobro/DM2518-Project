# DM2518-Project
Webapp development for a course at KTH

First install the following things.

	npm install -g cordova
	npm install -g ionic
	npm install -g typescript

Run this to install all the dependencies of the project.

	npm install


Commands to run the app:

	ionic server (to run it in the browser)

	ionic serve -l (runs it with options for all platforms)

Firebase reference:

NOTE: I have not added any npm install info about firebase, just install it
and google around if you get errors until "ionic serve" works.

(
Cordova plugins that might be useful:

	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-console
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-device
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation
